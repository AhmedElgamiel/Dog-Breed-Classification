# Dog-Breed-Classification

[Machine Learning Nanodegree]

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a dog breed identification application using convolutional neural networks. The resulting algorithm could be used as part of a mobile or web app. The code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 

## The Road Ahead

The overall flow consists of the following steps:

1. Import Datasets
2. Detect a human
3. Detect a dog
4. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
5. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
6. Write your Algorithm
7. Test Your Algorithm

## Software Stack

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7]
- [NumPy]
- [Pandas]
- [scikit-learn]
- [matplotlib]
